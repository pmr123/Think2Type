# Introduction

* Blind People have difficulties in using electronic devices. 
* Often they have to rely on helpers or other softwares which may not be very helpful for critical information passwords/bank accounts/etc.
* This causes privacy and security conserns.
* We aim to build a device which will help them to input all the required information without any external help.
* Directly capturing thoughts is hard as diffferent people think of same things differently and is computationaly difficult.
* Simplifying this issue by asking users to think in morse code and using motor signals to signify 0, 1 and /.
* This reduces complexity and generalize the model(As motor signals for same purpose do not vary much for different people)
